🧠 DNS and ICMP Traffic Analysis — Incident Report
📄 Overview

This project analyzes captured DNS and ICMP traffic during a simulated cybersecurity incident. The goal is to identify which network protocol was affected and determine the root cause of the “destination port unreachable” error encountered when attempting to access a client website.

The investigation is based on tcpdump packet captures showing failed DNS requests and ICMP error responses.
